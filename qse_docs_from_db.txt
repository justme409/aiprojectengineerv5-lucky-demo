 58087d0b-7832-4f54-94a6-df5547e96912 | QSE-10.2-PROC-01 - Procedure for Nonconformity, Incident & Corrective Action | procedure |           | QSE-10.2-PROC-01          | <h3>1.0 Purpose</h3><p>To establish a systematic digital process for identifying, reporting, investigating, and resolving nonconformities and incidents, and for implementing effective corrective actions to prevent their recurrence. The process is fully integrated with the QSE Management System for automated tracking, analytics, and dashboard monitoring.</p><h3>2.0 Process</h3><h4>2.1 Digital Identification & Automated Reporting</h4><p>Any employee or subcontractor can report a nonconformity or incident through the digital NCR reporting module with mobile app capability. Reports automatically notify supervisors and are formally logged in the Nonconformity & Corrective Action Register (QSE-10.2-REG-01) with timestamps, GPS location, photo evidence, and immediate supervisor assignment. Integration with project systems auto-links NCRs to specific Lot Register IDs and ITP references.</p><h4>2.2 Real-Time Containment & Immediate Correction</h4><p>The supervisor receives automatic notifications and is responsible for taking immediate action to contain the issue (e.g., quarantining nonconforming product, making a hazard safe). Containment actions are digitally recorded with photo evidence and automatically update the project dashboard for real-time visibility.</p><h4>2.3 Digital Investigation & Automated Root Cause Analysis</h4><p>The severity of the issue (auto-assigned by system risk algorithms) dictates the level of investigation required. A formal root cause analysis is conducted using digital investigation tools (5 Whys, Fishbone diagram templates) integrated within the system. Historical data analytics assist in identifying patterns and underlying causes.</p><h4>2.4 Automated Corrective Action Planning</h4><p>Based on the root cause analysis, a corrective action plan is developed using system templates to eliminate the cause and prevent recurrence. Actions are automatically assigned to responsible persons with due dates, progress tracking, and automated reminder notifications. All actions are cross-referenced with the Continual Improvement Register (QSE-10.3-REG-01).</p><h4>2.5 Digital Verification & Effectiveness Monitoring</h4><p>After implementation, the effectiveness of corrective actions is verified through digital evidence collection and automated monitoring of performance data from the dashboard analytics (<code>/dashboard</code>). The system tracks recurrence patterns and triggers alerts for ineffective corrective actions, automatically escalating to management review if required.</p>

The context is also reviewed during quarterly management review meetings.</p><ol><li><strong>Step 1: Data Gathering.</strong> The QSE Manager collates data from various sources, including PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental) analysis, SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis, market reports, client feedback, audit results, and performance data.</li><li><strong>Step 2: Analysis Workshop.</strong> The ELT analyzes the collated data to identify significant internal and external issues that could positively or negatively impact the IMS and business objectives.</li><li><strong>Step 3: Issue Documentation.</strong> Each identified issue is documented in the 'Register of Internal & External Issues' (QSE-4.1-REG-01), detailing its description, potential impact, and assigning an owner.</li><li><strong>Step 4: Integration with Risk Management.</strong> The identified issues are used as a primary input into the corporate risk and opportunity assessment process (ref: QSE-6.1-PROC-01). Issues also feed into the AI risk assessment in the WBS Agent for automated risk identification during project planning.</li></ol><h4>4.2 Identifying Interested Parties</h4><p>The identification of interested parties and their requirements is conducted in parallel with the context analysis.</p><ol><li><strong>Step 1: Stakeholder Mapping.</strong> During the annual workshop, the ELT conducts a stakeholder mapping exercise, identifying all relevant parties in predefined categories (e.g., Customers, Employees, Regulators, Suppliers, Community).</li><li><strong>Step 2: Determining Needs and Expectations.</strong> For each identified party, their relevant needs, expectations, and legal or other requirements are determined. This is gathered through formal (e.g., contracts, legislation) and informal (e.g., meetings, surveys) channels.</li><li><strong>Step 3: Requirement Documentation.</strong> All interested parties and their associated requirements are documented in the 'Register of Interested Parties & Their Requirements' (QSE-4.2-REG-01). The register includes the method and frequency of engagement for each party.</li><li><strong>Step 4: Compliance Obligation Link.</strong> Requirements that constitute a legal or compliance obligation are transferred to the 'Compliance Obligations Register' (ref: QSE-6.1-REG-01).</li></ol><h3>5.0 Monitoring, Review, and Update</h3><p>The context of the organization is dynamic and requires continuous monitoring. The registers associated with this procedure are considered live documents.</p><ul><li><strong>Formal Review:</strong> The CEO and ELT formally review the complete context analysis and associated registers during the annual strategic planning meeting and quarterly management reviews.</li><li><strong>Ongoing Monitoring:</strong> Department and Project Managers are responsible for monitoring their areas for any changes that could affect the context (e.g., new legislation, new client, major incident) and immediately reporting them to the QSE Manager.</li><li><strong>Triggered Updates:</strong> The registers must be updated immediately upon the identification of a new significant issue or interested party.</li></ul><h3>5.1 Monitoring Triggers</h3><p>The following events and indicators trigger immediate review and potential update of the organizational context:</p><ul><li>[Enter trigger criteria]</li><li>[Enter monitoring indicators]</li><li>[Enter escalation thresholds]</li><li>[Enter review frequencies]</li><li>[Enter notification requirements]</li></ul><h3>6.0 Records</h3><p>The following live records are maintained within the <code>/qse/corp-context</code> module:</p><ul><li><strong>QSE-4.1-REG-01:</strong> Register of Internal and External Issues</li><li><strong>QSE-4.2-REG-01:</strong> Register of Interested Parties and Their Requirements</li><li>Minutes of Management Meetings where context and interested parties are discussed.</li><li>Records from SWOT/PESTLE analysis workshops.</li></ul>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">1.0 Purpose</h3>
              <p>To define the process for planning, conducting, reporting, and following up on internal audits of the QSE Integrated Management System (IMS). This ensures the system's ongoing conformity to ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 45001 standards, and its effectiveness in achieving organisational objectives.</p>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">2.0 Digital Audit Programme & System Integration</h3>
              <p>An annual internal audit programme is developed by the QSE Manager using the system's integrated audit management module, based on the status and importance of the processes to be audited and the results of previous audits. High-risk areas and processes with poor performance indicators (automatically identified through dashboard analytics) are prioritised for more frequent audits. Audit scheduling and tracking are integrated with the monitoring dashboard (<code>/dashboard</code>) for real-time visibility.</p>
              
              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">3.0 Audit Process</h3>

              <h4>3.1 Digital Audit Planning</h4>
              <p>For each audit, a Lead Auditor will be assigned through the system's auditor competency management module and will be responsible for preparing a detailed Digital Audit Plan. The plan will specify the audit scope, objectives, criteria, and schedule, and is automatically distributed to all relevant stakeholders with notification tracking.</p>

              <h4>3.2 Digital Audit Execution</h4>
              <p>Audits will commence with a digital opening meeting to confirm the plan. The audit team will then gather objective evidence through interviews, observation of activities, and digital review of documents and records accessed through the document management system. All audit evidence is captured digitally with timestamps and audit trails. All auditors must remain impartial and objective.</p>

              <h4>3.3 Digital Reporting & Analytics</h4>
              <p>Audit findings will be classified as either a Non-conformance (Major/Minor) or an Opportunity for Improvement (OFI) through the integrated audit reporting module. A formal Digital Audit Report will be automatically generated and issued to the relevant managers with dashboard notifications. The report will summarise the findings and conclusions of the audit with trend analysis and performance metrics.</p>

              <h4>3.4 Automated Follow-up & Tracking</h4>
              <p>The manager responsible for the audited area must propose corrective actions for all non-conformances through the system's corrective action module. The effectiveness of these actions will be verified by the Lead Auditor through digital evidence collection before the finding can be automatically closed out. All corrective actions are tracked through the Continual Improvement Register (QSE-10.3-REG-01) with automated reminders and progress monitoring.</p>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">4.0 Digital Auditor Competency Management</h3>
              <p>All internal auditors must have completed a recognised internal auditor training course, with competency records maintained in the system's training management module (QSE-7.2-REG-01). Lead Auditors will have additional qualifications and experience in lead auditing techniques. Auditor qualifications and competency status are tracked through automatic alerts for renewal requirements and linked to the competency dashboard.</p>

              <h4 className="mt-8 mb-4">4.1 Determining Organizational Context</h4>
              <p>The context of the organization is formally determined through a structured workshop held annually as part of the strategic planning cycle, led by the CEO and facilitated by the QSE Manager. The context is also reviewed during quarterly management review meetings.</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1: Data Gathering.</strong> The QSE Manager collates data from various sources, including PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental) analysis, SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis, market reports, client feedback, audit results, and performance data.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2: Analysis Workshop.</strong> The ELT analyzes the collated data to identify significant internal and external issues that could positively or negatively impact the IMS and business objectives.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3: Issue Documentation.</strong> Each identified issue is documented in the 'Register of Internal & External Issues' (QSE-4.1-REG-01), detailing its description, potential impact, and assigning an owner.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4: Integration with Risk Management.</strong> The identified issues are used as a primary input into the corporate risk and opportunity assessment process (ref: QSE-6.1-PROC-01). Issues also feed into the AI risk assessment in the WBS Agent for automated risk identification during project planning.</li>
              </ol>

              <h4 className="mb-4">4.2 Identifying Interested Parties</h4>
              <p>The identification of interested parties and their requirements is conducted in parallel with the context analysis.</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1: Stakeholder Mapping.</strong> During the annual workshop, the ELT conducts a stakeholder mapping exercise, identifying all relevant parties in predefined categories (e.g., Customers, Employees, Regulators, Suppliers, Community).</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2: Determining Needs and Expectations.</strong> For each identified party, their relevant needs, expectations, and legal or other requirements are determined. This is gathered through formal (e.g., contracts, legislation) and informal (e.g., meetings, surveys) channels.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3: Requirement Documentation.</strong> All interested parties and their associated requirements are documented in the 'Register of Interested Parties & Their Requirements' (QSE-4.2-REG-01). The register includes the method and frequency of engagement for each party.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4: Compliance Obligation Link.</strong> Requirements that constitute a legal or compliance obligation are transferred to the 'Compliance Obligations Register' (ref: QSE-6.1-REG-01).</li>
              </ol>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">5.0 Monitoring, Review, and Update</h3>
              <p>The context of the organization is dynamic and requires continuous monitoring. The registers associated with this procedure are considered live documents.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Formal Review:</strong> The CEO and ELT formally review the complete context analysis and associated registers during the annual strategic planning meeting and quarterly management reviews.</li>
                <li><strong>Ongoing Monitoring:</strong> Department and Project Managers are responsible for monitoring their areas for any changes that could affect the context (e.g., new legislation, new client, major incident) and immediately reporting them to the QSE Manager.</li>
                <li><strong>Triggered Updates:</strong> The registers must be updated immediately upon the identification of a new significant issue or interested party.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">5.1 Monitoring Triggers</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">The following events and indicators trigger immediate review and potential update of the organizational context:</p>
              <ul className="mb-4">

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">1.0 Purpose</h3>
              <p>To establish a proactive and systematic digital approach to continual improvement, ensuring the QSE Integrated Management System (IMS) evolves to enhance performance, adapt to changing contexts, and deliver increasing value to stakeholders. The process is fully integrated with system analytics to automatically identify improvement opportunities and track implementation effectiveness through real-time dashboard monitoring.</p>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">2.0 Automated Sources of Improvement</h3>
              <p>Improvement opportunities are automatically identified and actively sought from integrated system sources, including:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Automated Data Analysis:</strong> Real-time review of performance data, audit results, and NCR trends from dashboard analytics (<code>/dashboard</code>) with AI-powered pattern recognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Stakeholder Feedback:</strong> Integrated suggestion system from employees, clients, and suppliers with automatic categorization and priority assignment.</li>
                <li><strong>Project-Based Lessons Learned:</strong> Automated extraction of lessons learned from completed projects and incidents via project management modules and NCR analytics.</li>
                <li><strong>Management Review Actions:</strong> Automatic import of improvement actions from Management Review outputs (QSE-9.3-REG-01) with progress tracking.</li>
                <li><strong>System Performance Analytics:</strong> Automated identification of inefficiencies through system usage analytics and process optimization algorithms.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Reference Integration:</strong> Automatic linking with Risk Register (QSE-6.1-REG-01), Audit findings (QSE-9.2-REG-01), and NCR patterns (QSE-10.2-REG-01).</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">3.0 Digital Workflow Process</h3>
              <p>All identified opportunities are automatically logged in the Continual Improvement Opportunities Register (QSE-10.3-REG-01) with unique tracking IDs. Each opportunity is then digitally evaluated using integrated assessment tools based on potential benefit, cost, and alignment with strategic objectives. Approved initiatives are planned and managed as formal projects with clear deliverables, timelines, automated progress tracking, and real-time dashboard monitoring. The system automatically generates status reports, sends reminder notifications, and tracks ROI for completed improvements.</p>

              <p>To define the systematic digital process for monitoring, measuring, analysing, and evaluating the QSE performance of [Company Name]'s operations and management system. This ensures that performance against objectives is understood through real-time dashboard analytics, compliance is maintained, and data-driven decisions are made to foster continual improvement.</p>
              
              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">2.0 Scope</h3>
              <p>This procedure applies to all activities across the organisation that monitor and measure QSE performance. This includes, but is not limited to, project site operations, workshop activities, and corporate functions.</p>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">3.0 Procedure Details</h3>
              
              <h4>3.1 Automated Digital Monitoring & Measurement</h4>
              <p>The key aspects to be monitored are defined in the company's QSE Objectives and Targets Plan and project-specific PMPs, with real-time data collection and dashboard display (<code>/dashboard</code>). These typically include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Conformance of work to specifications (e.g., survey results, material test reports), number of non-conformances (NCRs) from QSE-10.2-REG-01 with automated trend analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Lead and lag indicators such as the number of site inspections, positive observations, near misses, and LTIFR/TRIFR with real-time calculation and alert thresholds.</li>
                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Environmental monitoring results (e.g., water quality, noise levels), waste generation data, and incident reports with automatic compliance checking against legal obligations (QSE-6.1-REG-03).</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Status of compliance with all items listed in the Compliance Obligations Register with automated monitoring and alert notifications.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer Satisfaction:</strong> Digital feedback and results from customer surveys with automated analysis and improvement opportunity identification (QSE-10.3-REG-01).</li>
                <li><strong>System Performance:</strong> Digital analytics on user adoption, process efficiency, and automation effectiveness across all QSE modules.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>3.2 Digital Methods and Automated Frequency</h4>
              <p>Monitoring shall be conducted through various digital methods with automated data collection and real-time processing:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Inspections:</strong> Mobile app-based daily site safety walks, weekly environmental inspections, formal system audits with GPS tracking and photo evidence automatically uploaded to the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Testing Integration:</strong> Material sampling and testing results automatically imported into project ITPs with compliance checking.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Observation:</strong> Digital behavioural safety observations with immediate reporting and trend analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Data Review:</strong> Automated analysis of incident reports, NCRs, and customer feedback with AI-powered pattern recognition and alert generation.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The frequency of these activities is defined in project schedules, PMPs, and the Internal Audit Schedule, with automated scheduling and reminder notifications through the system.</p>

              <h4>3.3 Real-Time Analysis and Evaluation</h4>
              <p>Data collected from monitoring and measurement activities is automatically analysed using system analytics to identify trends, performance gaps, and opportunities for improvement in real-time. This analysis is continuously displayed on the monitoring dashboard (<code>/dashboard</code>) and forms a key input into monthly project reviews and the formal Management Review process. Performance variance alerts automatically trigger improvement opportunities in the Continual Improvement Register (QSE-10.3-REG-01).</p>
              
              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">4.0 Digital Records & Analytics</h3>
              <p>All records of monitoring, measurement, analysis, and evaluation are automatically maintained in the digital system as evidence of performance. This includes digital inspection checklists, test reports, audit findings, and meeting minutes with complete audit trails, timestamps, and cross-system integration. Performance analytics are automatically generated and displayed on the real-time monitoring dashboard for management oversight and decision-making.</p>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">1.0 Purpose</h3>
              <p>To establish a systematic digital process for identifying, reporting, investigating, and resolving nonconformities and incidents, and for implementing effective corrective actions to prevent their recurrence. The process is fully integrated with the QSE Management System for automated tracking, analytics, and dashboard monitoring.</p>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">2.0 Process</h3>
              
              <h4>2.1 Digital Identification & Automated Reporting</h4>
              <p>Any employee or subcontractor can report a nonconformity or incident through the digital NCR reporting module with mobile app capability. Reports automatically notify supervisors and are formally logged in the Nonconformity & Corrective Action Register (QSE-10.2-REG-01) with timestamps, GPS location, photo evidence, and immediate supervisor assignment. Integration with project systems auto-links NCRs to specific Lot Register IDs and ITP references.</p>
              
              <h4>2.2 Real-Time Containment & Immediate Correction</h4>
              <p>The supervisor receives automatic notifications and is responsible for taking immediate action to contain the issue (e.g., quarantining nonconforming product, making a hazard safe). Containment actions are digitally recorded with photo evidence and automatically update the project dashboard for real-time visibility.</p>

              <h4>2.3 Digital Investigation & Automated Root Cause Analysis</h4>
              <p>The severity of the issue (auto-assigned by system risk algorithms) dictates the level of investigation required. A formal root cause analysis is conducted using digital investigation tools (5 Whys, Fishbone diagram templates) integrated within the system. Historical data analytics assist in identifying patterns and underlying causes.</p>

              <h4>2.4 Automated Corrective Action Planning</h4>
              <p>Based on the root cause analysis, a corrective action plan is developed using system templates to eliminate the cause and prevent recurrence. Actions are automatically assigned to responsible persons with due dates, progress tracking, and automated reminder notifications. All actions are cross-referenced with the Continual Improvement Register (QSE-10.3-REG-01).</p>

              <h4>2.5 Digital Verification & Effectiveness Monitoring</h4>
              <p>After implementation, the effectiveness of corrective actions is verified through digital evidence collection and automated monitoring of performance data from the dashboard analytics (<code>/dashboard</code>). The system tracks recurrence patterns and triggers alerts for ineffective corrective actions, automatically escalating to management review if required.</p>

              <p>To define the process for conducting regular management reviews of the QSE Integrated Management System (IMS). This ensures the ongoing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the IMS and its alignment with the strategic direction of [Company Name]. Management review processes are supported by real-time dashboard analytics and automated data collection from all QSE system modules.</p>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">2.0 Frequency & Digital Scheduling</h3>
              <p>Management reviews will be conducted at least annually with automated calendar scheduling and reminder notifications through the system. Additional reviews may be convened to address significant changes or events, with automatic triggering based on performance threshold alerts from the monitoring dashboard. Review scheduling is integrated with participant availability and automatically distributes meeting materials from the system's data repositories.</p>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">3.0 Automated Data Inputs & Analytics</h3>
              <p>The management review shall consider a range of inputs, automatically compiled and analyzed by the system, including but not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The status of actions from previous management reviews (auto-tracked through QSE-10.3-REG-01).</li>
                <li>Changes in external and internal issues that are relevant to the IMS (auto-updated from context analysis).</li>
                <li>Information on QSE performance, including trends in customer satisfaction, objectives, non-conformities, and audit results (real-time dashboard analytics from <code>/dashboard</code>).</li>
                <li>The adequacy of resources (competency analysis from QSE-7.2-REG-01).</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of actions taken to address risks and opportunities (risk register analytics from QSE-6.1-REG-01).</li>
                <li>Opportunities for continual improvement (auto-identified through system performance analytics).</li>
                <li>Real-time project performance data from Lot Register, NCR Register, and ITP systems.</li>
                <li>Automated compliance monitoring reports from legal obligations tracking (QSE-6.1-REG-03).</li>

HTML = '''<h1>Procedure for Risk &amp; Opportunity Management</h1>
<p>This procedure sets out how [Company Name] applies ISO 31000 principles to identify, assess, and treat risks and opportunities within the Integrated Management System.</p>
<h2>1. Purpose</h2>
<p>Provide a disciplined, data-driven approach for managing risks and opportunities that could impact QSE objectives, project delivery, or stakeholder commitments.</p>
<h2>2. Scope</h2>
<p>Applies to corporate strategy, portfolio planning, and project execution handled through `/qse/corp-risk-management`, the dashboard, and project workspaces.</p>
<h2>3. Process</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Gather inputs from context reviews, compliance obligations, incident investigations, lessons learned, and analytics surfaced in `/dashboard` and `/app/projects/[projectId]/overview`.</li>
  <li><strong>Analysis &amp; Evaluation:</strong> Rate likelihood and consequence using the corporate 5x5 matrix; flag critical scenarios for executive review. AI-assisted WBS analyses automatically propose risk candidates for validation.</li>
  <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Define controls following the hierarchy (elimination to PPE). For opportunities, specify enablers, benefits, and owners. Link treatments to action assets so progress is tracked in QSE-10.3-REG-01.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Record approved entries in QSE-6.1-REG-01 (Risk Register) or QSE-6.1-REG-02 (Opportunity Register). Project-specific items map to lots, ITP checkpoints, or procurement workflows.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitoring &amp; Review:</strong> Review status quarterly at management review and dynamically via register dashboards. Update residual ratings and close actions in coordination with NCR and audit findings.</li>
</ol>
<h2>4. Roles</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Executive Leadership:</strong> Own strategic risks, approve treatment budgets, and monitor heatmaps.</li>
  <li><strong>Project Managers:</strong> Maintain project risk registers, integrate treatments into schedules, and escalate high residual risks.</li>
  <li><strong>Discipline Leads &amp; Engineers:</strong> Validate controls in the field, ensure SWMS and inspection plans reflect agreed treatments.</li>
  <li><strong>QSE Team:</strong> Facilitate workshops, administer registers, and ensure alignment with compliance and audit programs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Risk Matrix</h2>
<p>The corporate matrix assigns risk levels based on five likelihood and five consequence bands. Embed current matrix graphic or describe thresholds here (e.g., Extreme requires executive approval before work proceeds).</p>
<h2>6. Records &amp; Linkages</h2>
<ul>
  <li>QSE-6.1-REG-01 and QSE-6.1-REG-02 hold controlled records with version history.</li>
  <li>Associated actions are captured as assets with OUTPUT_OF edges to processing runs when AI assistance was used.</li>
  <li>Audit trails link risks to incidents (QSE-10.2) and inspections (IR register) for traceability.</li>

              <p className="mb-4">[Company Name] has systematically determined the external and internal issues that are relevant to its purpose and strategic direction, and that affect its ability to achieve the intended results of its IMS. This process, which is reviewed at least annually during management review meetings, is detailed in document <a href="/qse/corp-context">QSE-4.1-PROC-01 - Procedure for Determining Context of the Organization</a>. The outputs are maintained in the live registers within the <code>/qse/corp-context</code> module of the QSE system, including a comprehensive Register of Internal & External Issues and a Register of Interested Parties, which form critical inputs into our risk management process, strategic planning, and the overall IMS. The IMS is integrated with the project dashboard (<code>/dashboard</code>) to provide real-time visibility of organizational performance and context-related issues.</p>
              
              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">5.0 Leadership and Commitment</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">Top management at [Company Name] demonstrates leadership and commitment by taking full accountability for the effectiveness of the IMS. This is achieved through:</p>

              <p className="mb-4">The overall process is defined in <a href="/qse/corp-monitoring">QSE-9.1-PROC-01 - Performance Monitoring and Measurement</a>.</p>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">10.0 Improvement</h3>
              <p>Continual improvement is an underlying principle of our IMS and organizational culture. We drive improvement through:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Proactive identification of improvement opportunities from audits, risk assessments, and stakeholder feedback.</li>
                <li>A systematic approach to managing nonconformities and incidents, including thorough root cause analysis and the implementation of effective corrective actions to prevent recurrence.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">1.0 Scope of the Integrated Management System</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">The Integrated Management System (IMS) of [Company Name] encompasses all activities, processes, products, and services associated with the provision of civil construction, project management, and related engineering services. This includes, but is not limited to, earthworks, road construction, bridge construction, drainage, and utilities installation for clients in both the public and private sectors across Australia.</p>
              
              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">2.0 Organizational Boundaries and Facilities</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">The IMS is applicable to all personnel (permanent, temporary, and contract) and all operations conducted under the control of [Company Name]. The IMS applies to all activities managed within the [Company Name] QSE software platform, from head office functions (in the <code>/qse</code> module) to project delivery (in the <code>/projects</code> module). This includes activities at all company-controlled sites, defined as:</p>
              <ul className="mb-4">
                <li><strong>Head Office:</strong> The central administrative and management functions located at [Head Office Address].</li>
                <li><strong>State and Regional Offices:</strong> All permanent support offices, including those in [Regional Office Locations].</li>
                <li><strong>Project Sites:</strong> All active and future construction sites, laydown yards, and temporary work areas under the direct operational control of [Company Name] for the duration of a project contract.</li>
                <li><strong>Workshops and Maintenance Facilities:</strong> Any permanent or temporary facility used for the storage, maintenance, and repair of company-owned plant and equipment.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mb-4">The scope is defined by considering our compliance obligations, organizational units, functions, and physical boundaries.</p>
              
              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">3.0 Applicable Standards and Conformance</h3>
              <p>The IMS is designed to ensure conformance with the full requirements of the following standards:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>ISO 9001:2015:</strong> Quality Management Systems</li>
                <li><strong>ISO 14001:2015:</strong> Environmental Management Systems</li>
                <li><strong>ISO 45001:2018:</strong> Occupational Health & Safety Management Systems</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Furthermore, the scope includes our commitment to satisfying all applicable federal, state, and local legal requirements, relevant codes of practice, and all contractual requirements specified by our clients.</p>

              <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4">4.0 Justification for Non-Applicability (Exclusions)</h3>
              <p>To ensure the IMS accurately reflects our business model, the following clause of ISO 9001:2015 has been determined to be not applicable within our defined scope. This exclusion does not affect our ability or responsibility to consistently provide services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Clause 8.3 - Design and Development of Products and Services:</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Justification:</strong> [Company Name] operates primarily as a constructor, realizing designs that are provided by our clients or their appointed third-party design consultants. We do not engage in original, clean-sheet design and development activities that would necessitate the full application of this clause. Our quality management processes for controlling client-supplied designs, verifying inputs, and managing design changes during construction are addressed under Clause 8.2 (Requirements for Products and Services) and 8.5 (Production and Service Provision). Temporary works designs and management of client-supplied designs are controlled within the project's 'Documents' module and linked to relevant Lots.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>All other clauses of ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015, and ISO 45001:2018 are considered fully applicable to the scope of this Integrated Management System.</p>
